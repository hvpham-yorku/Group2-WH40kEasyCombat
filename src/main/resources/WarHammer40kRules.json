Otherwise, the attack fails and the  attack sequence ends.","type":"paragraph"},{"id":5,"position":[62.571800231933597,196.14129638671876,69.41180419921875,196.14129638671876,69.41180419921875,205.59130859375,62.571800231933597,205.59130859375],"score":1.0,"text":"4","type":"paragraph"},{"id":6,"position":[161.8553009033203,204.81427001953126,284.8477783203125,204.81427001953126,284.8477783203125,220.95574951171876,161.8553009033203,220.95574951171876],"score":1.0,"text":"Use the following sequence to make  attacks one at a time.","type":"paragraph"},{"id":7,"position":[221.6833038330078,235.31121826171876,225.24330139160157,235.31121826171876,225.24330139160157,241.6112060546875,221.6833038330078,241.6112060546875],"score":1.0,"text":"1","type":"paragraph"},{"id":8,"position":[204.1195068359375,253.186279296875,243.66671752929688,253.186279296875,243.66671752929688,260.9742431640625,204.1195068359375,260.9742431640625],"score":1.0,"text":"HIT ROLL","type":"paragraph"},{"id":9,"position":[221.3032989501953,274.82025146484377,225.29330444335938,274.82025146484377,225.29330444335938,281.22027587890627,221.3032989501953,281.22027587890627],"score":1.0,"text":"2","type":"paragraph"},{"id":10,"position":[193.85910034179688,293.1863098144531,253.15951538085938,293.1863098144531,253.15951538085938,300.97430419921877,193.85910034179688,300.97430419921877],"score":1.0,"text":"WOUND ROLL","type":"paragraph"},{"id":11,"position":[221.3032989501953,314.8202819824219,225.22329711914063,314.8202819824219,225.22329711914063,321.3102722167969,221.3032989501953,321.3102722167969],"score":1.0,"text":"3","type":"paragraph"},{"id":12,"position":[183.29429626464845,333.1863098144531,263.903076171875,333.1863098144531,263.903076171875,340.97430419921877,183.29429626464845,340.97430419921877],"score":1.0,"text":"ALLOCATE ATTACK","type":"paragraph"},{"id":13,"position":[221.0832977294922,354.9202880859375,225.643310546875,354.9202880859375,225.643310546875,361.22027587890627,221.0832977294922,361.22027587890627],"score":1.0,"text":"4","type":"paragraph"},{"id":14,"position":[190.47030639648438,373.1863098144531,257.05230712890627,373.1863098144531,257.05230712890627,380.97430419921877,190.47030639648438,380.97430419921877],"score":1.0,"text":"SAVING THROW","type":"paragraph"},{"id":15,"position":[221.4633026123047,394.9202880859375,225.37330627441407,394.9202880859375,225.37330627441407,401.3102722167969,221.4633026123047,401.3102722167969],"score":1.0,"text":"5","type":"paragraph"},{"id":16,"position":[187.1278076171875,413.1863098144531,260.3710021972656,413.1863098144531,260.3710021972656,420.97430419921877,187.1278076171875,420.97430419921877],"score":1.0,"text":"INFLICT DAMAGE","type":"paragraph"},{"id":17,"position":[306.31170654296877,264.78680419921877,523.279296875,264.78680419921877,523.279296875,293.0067443847656,306.31170654296877,293.0067443847656],"score":1.0,"text":"An unmodified Hit roll of 6 is called a Critical Hit and is always  successful.

Otherwise, the attack fails and the  attack sequence ends.","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[62.571800231933597,196.14129638671876,69.41180419921875,196.14129638671876,69.41180419921875,205.59130859375,62.571800231933597,205.59130859375],"paragraph_id":6,"page_id":21,"text":"4","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[161.8553009033203,204.81427001953126,284.8477783203125,204.81427001953126,284.8477783203125,220.95574951171876,161.8553009033203,220.95574951171876],"paragraph_id":7,"page_id":21,"text":"Use the following sequence to make  attacks one at a time.","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[221.6833038330078,235.31121826171876,225.24330139160157,235.31121826171876,225.24330139160157,241.6112060546875,221.6833038330078,241.6112060546875],"paragraph_id":8,"page_id":21,"text":"1","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[204.1195068359375,253.186279296875,243.66671752929688,253.186279296875,243.66671752929688,260.9742431640625,204.1195068359375,260.9742431640625],"paragraph_id":9,"page_id":21,"text":"HIT ROLL","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[221.3032989501953,274.82025146484377,225.29330444335938,274.82025146484377,225.29330444335938,281.22027587890627,221.3032989501953,281.22027587890627],"paragraph_id":10,"page_id":21,"text":"2","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[193.85910034179688,293.1863098144531,253.15951538085938,293.1863098144531,253.15951538085938,300.97430419921877,193.85910034179688,300.97430419921877],"paragraph_id":11,"page_id":21,"text":"WOUND ROLL","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[221.3032989501953,314.8202819824219,225.22329711914063,314.8202819824219,225.22329711914063,321.3102722167969,221.3032989501953,321.3102722167969],"paragraph_id":12,"page_id":21,"text":"3","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[183.29429626464845,333.1863098144531,263.903076171875,333.1863098144531,263.903076171875,340.97430419921877,183.29429626464845,340.97430419921877],"paragraph_id":13,"page_id":21,"text":"ALLOCATE ATTACK","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[221.0832977294922,354.9202880859375,225.643310546875,354.9202880859375,225.643310546875,361.22027587890627,221.0832977294922,361.22027587890627],"paragraph_id":14,"page_id":21,"text":"4","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[190.47030639648438,373.1863098144531,257.05230712890627,373.1863098144531,257.05230712890627,380.97430419921877,190.47030639648438,380.97430419921877],"paragraph_id":15,"page_id":21,"text":"SAVING THROW","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[221.4633026123047,394.9202880859375,225.37330627441407,394.9202880859375,225.37330627441407,401.3102722167969,221.4633026123047,401.3102722167969],"paragraph_id":16,"page_id":21,"text":"5","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[187.1278076171875,413.1863098144531,260.3710021972656,413.1863098144531,260.3710021972656,420.97430419921877,187.1278076171875,420.97430419921877],"paragraph_id":17,"page_id":21,"text":"INFLICT DAMAGE","tags":[],"type":"paragraph"},{"position":[306.31170654296877,264.78680419921877,523.279296875,264.78680419921877,523.279296875,293.0067443847656,306.31170654296877,293.0067443847656],"paragraph_id":18,"page_id":21,"text":"An unmodified Hit roll of 6 is called a Critical Hit and is always  successful.
